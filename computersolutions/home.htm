          <h2>NETWORKING</h2>
          <p>Networking can range from two computers sharing data and printers, to large corporates with several servers running Windows 2008, 2003, 2000, NT or Novell handling intranet (internal & external) emails, file sharing, security, printers, massive databases etc. Remote access, or linking offices together with VPN (Virtual Private network) or dial-in access is a specialty. Wireless networking is extremely popular, and is useful in premises where cables would be unsightly or difficult to run.</p>

          <h2>SERVERS</h2>
          <p>Small groups may not need a dedicated server. This can be a financial boon. Small companies can rarely afford to have capital tied up in a server if it is not needed. Simple filesharing, printer sharing, and even multi-user internet access is not an immediate requirement for a dedicated fileserver. If you already have more than one PC, getting them networked to enable file and printer sharing can be carried out extremely cheaply.</p>
